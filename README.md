## General info
This projects is based around the automation testing of the "Exactest" website. I am using this to improve my automation experience using a real world website. The website has been downloaded to run locally. Site was downloaded using the "HTTrack" tool.

## Setup
1. Load the ExactestFrameWorkArId into Eclipse
2. Load the downloaded "Exactest" website to a folder. Copy the localtion of the "index.html" file in the folder to the "launchUrl" setting in the config.properties file. 
3. To run the "Contact_Us" feature file set the "contactUsUrl" value to the following  location "file:///'NAME OF THE FOLDER THE WEBSITE WAS DOWNLOADED TO'/exactest.ie/contact-us/index.html"
4. In the config.properties file set the "reportConfigPath" value to "extent-config.xml" file that was loaded in step 1
5. Feature files have been set with the following tags:
@SmokeTest
@SystemTest
6. In the "TestRunner" class set the tag/tags which you wish to run
7. In the "TestRunner" class right click the mouse and select the option "Run As".."JUnit Test"
8. When tests have been executed the automatically generated report can be found at the following location "ExactestFrameWorkArId/target/cucumber-reports/Exactest report.html"

## Code Examples

  Scenario Outline: Veirify Phone Number error messages
    Given I am on the contact page
